# Data Science Projects

## About This Repository 
The repository compiles projects and assignments from my Introduction to Data Science course, which covered the following concepts: Python, Data Collection, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, and Data Science Ethics. After receiving this knowledge, I have been able to: 
1. Utilize validation techniques, such as cross-validation, in order to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well and fails to generalize to unseen data (i.e. outputs a lower testing accuracy). 
2. Create clear and informative data visualizations using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to effectively communicate insights from datasets. 
3. Approach complex problems systematically, formulate hypotheses, analyze data, and derive actionable insights to inform decision-making.
